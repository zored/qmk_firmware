# QMK Ergodox EX Zored keymap

Differences from basic EZ config:
- Shorten finger movement:
	- Letters-modifiers (`z` is `ctrl` for example).
	- Numbers stand for F-keys.
	- Numbers themself are on seperate layer.
- [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/) layer.
- Easy to access symbols for programming.
- For fast touch-typing (no distracting lights, low timeouts).

See [keymap](./keymap.c) for details.
